      The software provides real-time monitoring to ensure recording quality, automatic file naming for organized data management, and session tracking to simplify data handling.</p> <p>Before data is saved, the software applies a dedicated signal processing pipeline, which includes a 5th-order Butterworth high-pass filter (50 Hz cutoff), DC offset removal, signal normalization, and precise timing synchronization between the two microphones.</p> <p>Captured signals are saved directly to the laptop in a standardized WAV file format (32-bit), with the throat microphone data upsampled to 16 kHz and the acoustic microphone data sampled at 16 kHz. 
      Files follow a consistent naming convention to facilitate straightforward dataset usage.</p> <div class="img-container"><img src="/images/documentation/data-collection/software.png" alt="Data Collection"> <div class="image-caption">Data Collection Software</div></div></div></div>`);function T(n,s){p(s,!1);let a="Data Collection Software";m(()=>{document.title=`${a} | TAPS Documentation`}),l();var t=v();u(w=>{f.title=`${a} | TAPS Documentation`});var e=i(t),r=i(e);r.textContent=a,o(e),g(2),o(t),d(n,t),h()}export{T as component};
